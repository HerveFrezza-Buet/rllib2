# RLlib2

The rllib2 is a C++ library for generic programming of reinforcement learning. In this repository, you will find the core matter, rllib2, and a rllib2-eigen library.

The former contains all the concepts and the main algorithms that can be written regardless the specific numerical library that is used for inner computations. The latter, rllib2-eigen, uses the eigen library to implement these computations. Further implementations with other numerical libraries, as gsl, may be considered in the future.
